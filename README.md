# AVR Ada
A clone of Rolf Ebert's AVR Ada project. Build script by Tero Koskinen.

Introduction:

This is my sandbox where I'm working to make the process of building the AVR Ada cross compiler
less painful. In going forward the goal is to add support for more peripherals and devices.

Rolf's AVR Ada project page is here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/avr-ada/


Prerequisites:

apt-get install libmpfr-dev
apt-get install libmpc-dev


Building: (Experimental!)

Run the build script and cross your fingers:

> ./build.sh
